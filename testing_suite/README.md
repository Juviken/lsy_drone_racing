# Autonomous Drone Racing Project Course

# Testing Suite for controller

These are files that are used to test the overall trajectory planner used in the "final_controller".

# Requirements

The only requirement not present in parent folder installation guide is: mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

# Usage

Can be used to generate trajectories that can then be used with the controller "final_controller"

When running the optimization the trajectory is saved in the same manner as the optimization in "final_controller" but with the suffix " \_test "
